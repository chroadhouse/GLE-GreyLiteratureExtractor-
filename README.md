# GLE-GreyLiteratureExtractor-

This program uses the python googlesearch library, which retreievs a list of URL's based on a prompt. 
The program then:
- searches the urls
- scrapes the html
- extracts the text from the html
- runs a topic modelling model on the code 
- Finally outputs the data to a csv and stores all text with a corresponding ID in a folder
